# Streamlit Demo: The Controllable GAN Face Generator
This project highlights Streamlit's new `hash_func` feature with an app that calls on TensorFlow to generate photorealistic faces, using Nvidia's [Progressive Growing of GANs](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-10_Progressive-Growing-of) and Shaobo Guan's [Transparent Latent-space GAN](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/generating-custom-photo-realistic-faces-using-ai-d170b1b59255) method for tuning the output face's characteristics. For more information, check out the [tutorial on Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-machine-learning-apps-with-streamlit-667cef3ff509). 

The Streamlit app is [implemented in only 150 lines of Python](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-face-gan/blob/master/app.py) and demonstrates the wide new range of objects that can be used safely and efficiently in Streamlit apps with `hash_func`.

## How to run this demo
The demo requires Python 3.6 or 3.7 (The version of TensorFlow we specify in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-face-gan/blob/master/requirements.txt#L14) is supported in Python 3.8+). **We suggest creating a new virtual environment**, then running:

```
git clone https://github.com/streamlit/demo-face-gan.git
cd demo-face-gan
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
